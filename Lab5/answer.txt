DNA Assembly from Random Samples — Report

Provided sequence length: 2316 nt
Random reads: 2000
Read length range: 100–150 bases
Minimum overlap (k): 20 bases
Assembled length: 233703 nt

Reconstruction check:
- Exact match with original: False
- Assembled contains original: False
- Original contains assembled: False

Main issue with this algorithmic approach:
Even with 2000 reads of 100–150 bp from the original sequence, overlaps are frequently
ambiguous in repetitive regions and some positions may lack sufficient overlapping coverage.
A greedy, local-overlap strategy makes irreversible choices, which can misjoin or fragment contigs.
Robust assembly typically relies on coverage-aware, graph-based methods (de Bruijn/overlap graphs)
with error models; this simple greedy approach is not reliable for exact reconstruction.
